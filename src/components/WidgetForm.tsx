/*  notes about properties used in WidgetForm
    * ***** used in first div *****
    * rounded-2xl: rounded with 1rem, or 16px
    * mb: margin-bottom; we want the form to stay away from the button area
    * flex-col: we want the header, content, and the footer to be on top of each other, not side by side
    * items-center: centralize contents
    * shadow-lg: shadow on each item to create an illusion of it being distanced from the background
    * w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]: calculating the width using tailwnid. 
    *         100vw = 100% of  viewport (total available view)
    *         -2rem = since we're using padding of (p-4), we're shrinking its size a little
    * sm, md, lg: small, medium, large (screen sizes)
    * ***** used in button *****
    * bg-zinc-800 : backgound color zinc
    * rounded-lg : rounded large
    * py-5 : padding y
    * w-24 : width
    * gap-2 : gap between icon and text
    * flex : makes elements flexbox
    * flex-col : makes img and text stay on top of each other
    * flex-1 : since the parent element (in this case, div) is 'flex', flex-1 will expand its width (beyond the defined w-24) in case the parent element container is bigger
    * items-center: center img and txt inside the button      
    * border-2 : creates a white border with 2px, to change colors when we hover
    * border-transparent : makes the white border transparent so it doesn't show up
    * hover:border-brand-500 : makes the border show in color brand-500 when we hover the button
    * focus:border-brand-500 : when the user is navigating using the keyboard. but the color by default is white, so we use the next one:
    * focus:outline-none : to remove the white default border, and use our own color

/**
 * Why we created an arrow function?*
 * - We need to pass a function to our button's onClick property
 * - If we simply use onClick={setFeedbackType} we will pass the function, but not the argument that
 * we want (key), which is the value chosen by the user.
 * - If we use onClick={setFeedbackType(key)}, we will be calling the function right away, and we'll pass
 * its return value to onClick()
 * - That's why we need to create an arrow function. The following:
 * () => setFeedbackType (key)
 * is a function, and not a function call. So, passing it to onClick, as in:
 * onClick={ () => setFeedbackType(key) }
 * is what we want: passing the function, the argument, but without actually calling the function.
 * -------------------------
 * Another note:
 * just assigning 'key' doesn't automatically tell the script which type it is.
 * so we are adding 'as FeedbackType' to manually force it to be either "BUG", "IDEA" or "OTHER"
